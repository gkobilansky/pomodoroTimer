Stay in flow by using this timer

## Timeboxing
 
Do have a hard time staying focused and productive at work? Do you spend the whole day "multi-tasking" and look back on it only to realize you've accomplished nothing?

Yea, happens to me too. 

I find that I'm most effective when concentrating on a single task for a set duration of time. Something not too long; say around 25 minutes. Then I take a break (5 min) and get back to it with another 25 minute sprint. Basically <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/High-intensity_interval_training" target="_blank">HIIT</a> for productivity. 

It's called timeboxing, but I found my way to the method through The Pomodoro TechniqueÂ® (a little more on that later).

The principle is simple. Which, as Bruce Lee would teach us, means it's probably effective:

```
Work Sprint -> Short Break -> Work Sprint -> Short Break -> Work Sprint -> Long Break

```

That's three work sessions followed by a longer break. My timer help you automate this progression and allows you to customize the length of both your work session and your break sessions.

Basically, the flow timer (<a href="http://timer.flowathletics.com">timer.flowathletics.com</a>) takes the hard work out of working smart. 

And there's one big bonus - instead of being treated to an annoying buzzer at the end of your work/break session, you hear one of my personally collected Bruce Lee sayings instead. Just a little bit of extra motivation to stay in flow.
